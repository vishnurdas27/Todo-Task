## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Input Task:** The user enters a task description in the input field.
2. **Select Category:** The user selects a specific tag (e.g., Work, Personal) from the dropdown menu.
3. **Add Item:** The user clicks the **Add Task** button.
4. **Update View:** The new task appears in the list, assigned to its respective category.
5. **Filter List:** Clicking on a tag button at the top filters the task list to show only items matching that selected category.
